new resume notes:
	Ok, looks like the multi-line typing is good. next question: how do i get the text to scroll down? hmmm. put it in it's own div? no idea. 

	next:
	verify HTML for bugs
	verify CSS for bugs

PROBLEM:
	SERVER ISN'T TALKING TO CLOUDATCOST

	blahhhhhh, i can't login to cloudatcost AGAIN!
	WHATS THE PROBLEM HERE?

	some comibnation of username, and password. Ive done it before...

	GOT IT: It's ssh root@162.219.4.83
	then type password: Sweet1cloudatcost

	ok, NOW it's working... but how do i get Node to host all the time (even when the terminal closes)
		1) nohup node index.js &
		2) screen
		3) npm install pm2 -g
		pm2 start index.js

		ok, so that one works so far (will the server go to speep ever? I know that pm2 is designed for this... but i'm not using it? Oh well!)

Verified HTML and CSS

solving: resume is creeping over onto the text side. I need to set it in a div and that in a width. 
	Yay! Im using divs and it's working CRAZY better.'

NOTE: TO RUN NODE ON UNIVERSAL PORT 80 I MUST USE SUDO!!!

ok, all that is pretty good, now it's just time to upload my picture and be done and apply to stuff!

to run:
	nohup node server.js &
to get info:
	ps -ef | grep "node"
to kill it: 
	kill 9500 (where 9500 is whatever PID you got)

Hmm, having some trouble restarting the auto-run node on the cloudatcost server =(

NEXT TRY: INSTALL software to run the server forever!
	sudo apt-get install upstart - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5818202/how-to-run-node-js-app-forever-when-console-is-closed

Huh, i got the server running, but i can't get the local one running? Huh, well, oh well!
